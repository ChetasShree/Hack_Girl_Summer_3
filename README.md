## Inspiration💡
We noticed that there is no unified marketplace to cater to the needs of small bakery owners, which in turn hindered their progress. The existing platforms in the market were not meant to garner the attention of their target audience.

Covid saw the rise of multiple small businesses and start-ups. We at Republic of Bakers want to provide these budding entrepreneurs with a holistic platform where they can showcase and market their work without having to bother about the nitty-gritty details.

Our main goal is to leverage small businesses to their potential, empowering them financially and economically.


## What it is ? 🎠
Republic of Bakers provides home-bakers with a user-friendly app, where they can showcase their work and products without any external factors that take away from the main focus. It will help streamline customers in a more efficient way with a recommendation system. Mainly bulti to uplift and encourage women into business , they can sell and make money with things they do daily like baking and all
